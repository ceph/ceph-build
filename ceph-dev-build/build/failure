# The ceph-container dir is supposed to get deleted in the build_rpm script.
# We used to add '|| true' to the container build so the dir would still get
# deleted even if it failed.  This changed in https://github.com/ceph/ceph-build/pull/1603
# So now we need to delete the directory or the Wipe Workspace plugin will fail on the next build.
