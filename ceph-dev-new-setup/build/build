# This is a dev release, enable some debug cmake configs. Note: it has been
# this way since at least 35e1a715. It's difficult to tell when or even if ceph
# was ever properly built with debugging configurations for QA as there are
# corresponding changes in ceph with the switch to cmake which makes this
# challenging to evaluate.
#
# It's likely that it was wrongly assumed that cmake would set the build type
# to Debug because the ".git" directory would be present. This is not the case
# because the "make-dist" script (executed below) creates a git tarball that is
# used for the actual untar/build. See also:
#
# https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/53800
#
# Addendum and possibly temporary restriction: only enable these for branches
# ending in "-debug".
