# This file will set the tgz images needed for pbuilder on a given host. It has
# some hard-coded values like `/srv/debian-base` because it gets built every
# time this file is executed - completely ephemeral.  If a Debian host will use
# pbuilder, then it will need this. Since it is not idempotent it makes
# everything a bit slower. ## FIXME ##
