# run ansible to get this current host to meet our requirements, specifying

# requirements are the same: install different versions of Python (including
# 2.6 and 2.7)

# These job-specific requirements aren't met by the services in charge of
# creating Jenkins builders (mainly prado.ceph.com) because those slaves have "generic"
# requirements and usually do not care about specific needs like Python 2.6
