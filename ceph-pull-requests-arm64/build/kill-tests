# kill all descendant processes of ctest

# ceph-pull-requests-arm64/build/build is killed by jenkins when the ceph-pull-requests-arm64 job is aborted or
# canceled, see https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/aborting-a-build/ . but build/build does not
# wait until all its children processes quit. after ctest is killed by SIGTERM, there is chance
# that some tests are still running as ctest does not get a chance to kill them before it terminates.
# if these tests had timed out, ctest would kill them using SIGKILL. so we need to kill them
# manually after the job is aborted.

# if ctest is still running, get its pid, otherwise we are done.

# the parent process of ctest should have been terminated, but this might not be true when
# it comes to some of its descendant processes, for instance, unittest-seastar-messenger
